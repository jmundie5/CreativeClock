Clock Assignment for UMW Creative Coding

For this assignment, I really had a harder time finding inspiration that matched my ability in the p5js language. I poked around with some ideas for an analog clock but was never satisfied with the spacing and overall look of the final product. I also poked around with the idea of creating a binary clock, but my experience with p5js made this approach a bit harder without relying heavily on online tutorials. Realizing I had eaten through work days on failed projects, I decided on a small clock widget with the current time displayed in digital and a corresponding background/animation. During the day, a small sun rotates in the top corner and during the night the background becomes black and an array of stars twinkle. The main concept behind this clock is that it could fit easily on the homescreen of a smart device, but work well with light and dark UI modes switching. This could be further expanded with more intricate animations for a broader spectrum of times of day.
